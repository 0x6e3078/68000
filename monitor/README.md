This is the 68000 monitor and mini monitor for the Teesside TS2 single
board computer from the book "Microprocessor Systems Design - 68000
Hardware, Software, and Interfacing", third edition, by Alan Clements.

This is based on the version on the included CD-ROM with changes to
assemble under the GNU assembler.

I have not tested it, other than getting it to assemble.
