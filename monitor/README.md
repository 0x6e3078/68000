This is the 68000 monitor for the Teesside TS2 single board computer
from the book "Microprocessor Systems Design - 68000 Hardware,
Software, and Interfacing", third edition, by Alan Clements.

This is based on the version on the included CD-ROM with changes to
assemble under the GNU assembler.

The original versions can be found on the "original" folder.

I have not tested it, other than getting it to assemble and confirming
that the assembled output matches the original.
